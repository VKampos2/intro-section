## Overview
Intro section with dropdown menu, built with html 5, css and bootstrap framework.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I started by creating a id section called title, then putting the navbar and hero zone inside a conteiner-fluid div. the navbar and the hero zone was done using bootstrap framework. the most difficult was to make the mobile version, i don't know javascript yet, so i did everything using just hmtl and css.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- bootstrap
- CSS grid
- desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned more about css grid, and how to chose which grid-row should star first when device is changed if affets the layout of the page.
I also did a funny sidebar, using css properties :)!

### Continued development
CSS!
There is a lot to learn.
